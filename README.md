# Magic Lambda HTTP

Provides HTTP REST capabilities for Magic. More specifically this project provides the following 4 slots.

* __[http.get]__ - Returns some resource using the HTTP GET verb towards the specified URL
* __[http.delete]__ - Deletes some resource using the HTTP DELETE verb
* __[http.post]__ - Posts some resources to some URL using the HTTP POST verb
* __[http.put]__ - Puts some resources to some URL using the HTTP PUT verb
* __[http.patch]__ - Patches some resources to some URL using the HTTP PATCH verb

The __[http.put]__, __[http.post]__ and __[http.patch]__ slots requires you to provide a __[payload]__
or __[filename]__ argument that will be transferred to the endpoint as is. All 4 endpoints can (optionally)
take a __[token]__ arguments, which will be transferred as a `Bearer Authorization` token to the endpoint
in the HTTP Authorization header of your request. If you provide a __[filename]__ argument, this is assumed
to be a file relatively existing within your _"/files/"_ folder somewhere.

Notice, if you want to have more control over your HTTP request, you can also explicitly add your own
**[header]** collection, which will become the HTTP request's headers, where the header name is the name
of the node, and its value is the value of the node. Below is a simple example of retrieving the document
found at the specified URL, using a simple GET HTTP request, without neither a **[token]** nor **[header]**
collection.

```
http.get:"https://google.com"
```

## POSTing, PUTting, and PATCHing data

The POST, PUT and PATCH slots, requires a **[payload]** argument, or a **[filename]** argument,
that becomes the body of the request. Below is an example illustrating how to create a POST request, with
a Bearer token to access the end resource.

```
http.post:"https://some-url.com"
   token:qwerty_secret_JWT_token_goes_here
   payload:some mumbo jumbo payload, typically JSON and not text though ...
```

**Notice** - If you want to submit a large file to some endpoint, without loading the file into memory
first, you should rather use **[filename]** instead of **[payload]**. This ensures the file is submitted
to your endpoint without loading it into memory first.

```
http.post:"https://some-url.com"
   filename:/README.md
```

## HTTP headers

Below is another example invoking DELETE with an explicit **[headers]** collection.

```
http.delete:"https://foo-url.com"
   headers
      Accept:application/zip
      X-Foo:Bar-Header-Value
```
